# Create and Format

Word is the most commonly used application for Respondus, however, Respondus will also accept text \(`.txt`\) and rich text format \(`.rtf`\) files from other applications.

## Basic Formatting

1. There should be no headers, headings, or footers in the document.
2. Each question needs to be preceded with “TYPE:” except for Multiple Choice andTrue / False. See

   examples below.

3. Each question should begin with a number followed by a period“.” or right parenthesis“\)”.
4. The question should follow the question number with one space after the period or right parenthesis.
5. Each answer choice should begin with an upper or lower case letter followed by a period or right parenthesis.
6. Correct answers are designated by placing an asterisk BEFORE the answer choice with NO spaces. \(This can be difficult in Word so you may have to save the document as “plain text” and then go back and edit the document.\)
7. There should be no headers, footers or other items on the document other than the questions.
8. True/ False questions can use answer choices "True" or "T" and "False" or "F".

## Formatting Specific Question Types

**Multiple Choice**

This is the default question type so you don’t need to add the “TYPE”.

```text
1. Who determined the exact speed of light? 

a. Albert Einstein  
*b. Albert Michelson  
c. Thomas Edison
```

**True / False**

If the True answer is typed first you don’t need to add the “TYPE”. If not, it defaults to Multiple Choice. True/False questions can use answer choices “True” or “T” and “False” or “F.”

```text
2) Albert Michelson determined the exact speed of light?  
 *a. True  
 b. False
```

**Multiple Answers**

```text
Type: MA

3. Which of the following individuals are credited with determining the exact speed of light?

**Images with Questions**

Images embedded in Word will import automatically into Respondus. Images can also be inserted manually into text files by using specific formatting. Images must be gif, jpg, or jpeg formats. Place the following tag where the image should appear: `[img: “filename.jpg”]` using the actual name of the file in place of filename.jpg. You can even add ADA-compliant text for students using screen readers by placing text within quotes right after the filename.

```text
[img: “stonehenge.jpg” “Picture of Stonehenge”]
```
