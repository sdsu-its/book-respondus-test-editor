## Now What?

Now you can deploy the test in Blackboard as you would with any Blackboard test or survey. Once published to Blackboard, the test resides in the Test manager \(Control Panel =&gt; Course Tools =&gt; Tests, Surveys and Pools\). You can edit the test or set your test options just like any other Blackboard test.
